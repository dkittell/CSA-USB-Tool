# CSA-USB-Tool 

This tool downloads all the installers/packages for a given FRC season. CSA's commonly need these on hand in a USB to help
teams update to the latest version or to diagnose issues.

## Breaking changes incoming! (CSA USB Tool v2)

There is currently a very heavy rewrite being done in the background as I have time to do it.
Goals of this rewrite are as follows:

- Multi-platform support
	- Specifically support for OSX/Linux via a Command Line interface
	- Windows included for CLI
- Move off of WinForms
	- It sucks. 
- Migration to a better format/organization of the software available per season
	- Unknown whether this will still be a CSV, or if it'll be a different format like JSON.
	- This would also enable better support for external tools wanting to make use of the updated lists
- Provide better crash/bug reporting/logging and metrics (opt-out)
	- This is done via DevCycle (my work) - with anonymous data/metrics recording of what software is downloaded and when to provide better understanding of when the tool is used.
- Provide a proper installer for Windows
	- This would allow you to update the tool year to year without re-downloading it and just checking for an update (Windows only unfortunately).
- Signed Windows binaries
	- Code-signed binary to prevent smartscreen warnings.
- FTA specific tooling
	- TBD

These changes are expected to be a breaking change - where the old season file lists will be converted; but no new versions will be added to the "Years.txt" requiring an update to the base binary.

## Download/Usage

Download the release zip file from the GitHub releases on the right hand side -> 

There is a C# GUI available as a github release (recommended), or you can use the `pyusbtool.py` python script. The Python script is not packaged with the release; but you can download it standalone from the repo.

Example usage of the python script on unix based systems:

```console
$ ./pyusbtool.py FRCSoftware<YEAR>.csv /path/to/drive/ --download
$ ./pyusbtool.py FTCSoftware<YEAR>.csv /path/to/drive/ --download
```

Example usage of the powershell script on windows/unix based systems:

```console
$ ./pshusbtool.ps1 -csvFileURL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JamieSinn/CSA-USB-Tool/main/FTCSoftware<YEAR>.csv -csvFilePath /Users/username/CSA/FTC<YEAR>/
$ ./pshusbtool.ps1 -csvFileURL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JamieSinn/CSA-USB-Tool/main/FRCSoftware<YEAR>.csv -csvFilePath /Users/username/CSA/FRC<YEAR>/
```
